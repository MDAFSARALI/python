# Format method used when abstring method is present because at the starting abstring method was not introduced so format method is usable.
# Now aday abstring method is somewhere is usable because the programmer does not change the all abstring method into format method so we have to learn it.
# Now a days:
'''name="Afsar"
a=f"This is {name}"
print(a)'''
# previous days:
name="Afzal"
channel="CodeWithHarry"
type="coding"
# a="This is {} and his channel name is{} ".format(name,channel)
# If we want to change the position:
a="This is {0} and his channel name is{1} and type is {2} ".format(name,channel,type)# Here we can see the position has been changed.
print(a)
