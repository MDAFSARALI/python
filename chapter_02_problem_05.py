# Q:Write a python program to calculate the average of the two numbers let a=12 and b=26
'''a=12
b=26
print("The average of the two numbers a and b is ",(a+b)/2)'''
# If we want to take the input of a and b from the user then 
a=input("Enter the value of a")
a=int (a)
b=input("Enter the value of b")
b=int (b)
print("Average of the a and b is",(a+b)/2)
